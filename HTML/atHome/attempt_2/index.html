            This is my first webpage! I was able to code all the HTML 
            and CSS in order to make it. Watch out world of web design 
            here I come! I can use my skills here to create websites 
            for my business, my friends and family, my C.V, blog 
            or articles. As well as any games or more experiment 
            stuff (which is what the web is really all about).
